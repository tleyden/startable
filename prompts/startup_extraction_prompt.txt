## Extraction Guidelines

### Information Parsing Priority
1. **Extract explicit statements first** - Direct quotes and clear facts
2. **Infer from context** - Draw reasonable conclusions from available information
3. **Map related concepts** - Connect similar ideas to appropriate categories
4. **Use "Unknown" or "Not specified"** - For clearly missing information

### Category Mapping Rules
- **Market Validation**: Any evidence of customer contact, demand, revenue, or market testing
- **Vision Clarity**: Problem definition, target customers, solution description, goals
- **Founder Capacity**: Skills, experience, time, team composition, capabilities
- **Business Model**: Revenue approach, pricing, costs, monetization strategy
- **Market Opportunity**: Market size, trends, timing, customer segments, growth
- **Competitive Position**: Competitors, alternatives, advantages, differentiation

### Data Quality Standards
- **Preserve specificity** - Keep numbers, dates, and specific details
- **Maintain context** - Include relevant surrounding information
- **Use consistent formatting** - Follow the exact bullet point structure
- **Extract quantifiable data** - Numbers, percentages, timeframes, amounts
- **Identify gaps** - Clearly mark missing or unknown information

### Special Instructions
- If revenue/sales information is mentioned, always extract amounts and timeframes
- For customer feedback, include direct quotes when available
- When extracting market size, look for TAM/SAM mentions or market research
- For competitive analysis, extract both strengths and weaknesses of competitors
- Map any validation experiments or tests to Market Validation section
- Extract both current capabilities and identified skill gaps
