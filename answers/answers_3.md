3### 1. What is the core problem you are trying to solve, and for whom?  
Small independent retailers struggle to compete with large e-commerce platforms due to limited access to affordable, data-driven inventory planning tools. This results in stockouts, overstocking, and cash flow challenges. We are solving this problem for small to mid-sized brick-and-mortar retailers who need smarter inventory decisions without enterprise-level costs.

### 2. What is your proposed solution, and how is it different from or better than existing solutions?  
We are building **StockWise**, an AI-powered inventory optimization platform that integrates directly with POS systems to provide predictive restocking recommendations. Unlike existing enterprise software, StockWise is:  
- **Affordable:** Priced for small businesses, not large chains.  
- **Plug-and-play:** Requires no technical expertise or IT team.  
- **Localized insights:** Tailored for local market conditions and seasonal trends rather than broad, generic forecasts.

### 3. What is the long-term vision for your idea, and how will it create a sustainable business?  
Our long-term vision is to become the go-to operational intelligence platform for small retailers globally, expanding beyond inventory to include demand forecasting, supplier negotiation tools, and automated purchasing. Revenue will come from a subscription model with tiered pricing, ensuring predictable income while delivering ongoing value. As our user base grows, data network effects will improve our AI models, further differentiating us from competitors.

### 4. What unique skills and experiences does your founding team bring to the table?  
Our team combines deep retail experience with advanced technical expertise:  
- **CEO:** Former small business consultant with a decade of experience optimizing inventory workflows for local stores.  
- **CTO:** Ex-Lead Data Scientist at a major retail analytics firm, specializing in predictive modeling.  
- **COO:** Former operations manager at a mid-sized retail chain who understands the day-to-day challenges of inventory management.

### 6. How does your team's background give you a competitive advantage in the market you're entering?  
Our first-hand knowledge of small retailer pain points allows us to design tools that are intuitive and practical. Having worked inside both small businesses and large analytics companies, we understand how to balance sophistication with usability. Our existing network of independent retailers gives us immediate access to pilot customers and feedback loops.

### 7. Where are you in your startup journey right now?  
We have a working prototype integrated with two POS systems and are running pilot programs with five independent retailers. Early results show a 15% reduction in stockouts and improved cash flow management.

### 8. What is the single most important thing you need to figure out next to move forward?  
We need to validate our pricing model and refine our onboarding process to ensure that small retailers can adopt the product quickly without hand-holding.

### 9. What kind of help or resources would make it easier to take that next step?  
Connections to experienced SaaS mentors who have scaled products for small businesses, as well as introductions to early-stage investors who understand the retail technology space, would accelerate our progress. A small seed round would help us enhance onboarding automation and expand our pilot program.
