What is the core problem you are trying to solve, and for whom?
We are solving management of chronic wounds for smalled outpatient clinics and hospitals.
What is your proposed solution, and how is it different from or better than existing solutions?
It is an app and a dashboard that helps them proactively monitor and care for patients. It is better than existing solutions as it uses multimodal data like wound images, bio chemical lab data and physiological data from smartwatchees.
What is the long-term vision for your idea, and how will it create a sustainable business?
Long term we want to develop an end to end platform for chronic wounds for all types of caregivers including family. We will create a sustainable business by selling it as a SaaS with monthly subscriptions.
What unique skills and experiences does your founding team bring to the table?
I am an expert in ML and Product development after working as a MLE ins everal early stage startups and scaleups. My cofounder is a medical doctor specialised in medical informatics and systems integration.
What is your team's shared passion or long-term vision that will drive you through challenges?
We both have experience firsthand as patients of chronic wounds and a shared drive to improve the system that is strained.
How does your team's background give you a competitive advantage in the market you're entering?
We have both the medical and technical expertise to make the product work. We are also both very well connected in VC and Influential Circles.
Where are you in your startup journey right now? (e.g., just an idea, have a basic prototype, have a few users, etc.)
We have some demos for the ML parts and basic prototypes for the dashboard and app. We also have funding for ourselves the next 6 months and 20000 euro of contingency money from a a govt grant.
What is the single most important thing you need to figure out next to move forward? (e.g., validating the problem with potential users, building the first version of the product, finding a co-founder, etc.)
We need to figure out how to gain initial traction and take the product to the next stage of regualtory compliance.
What kind of help or resources would make it easier to take that next step? (e.g., mentorship from an expert, a small amount of funding to cover initial costs, connections to potential partners, etc.)
We need more funding and regulatory expertise along with some strong hires in sales.
